# Copilot Instructions

## Overview
This repository appears to contain educational materials, likely for teaching programming concepts. The structure includes HTML and JavaScript files organized into folders named by lessons (e.g., `Aula 001`, `Aula 11`).

## Project Structure
- **HTML Files**: These files (e.g., `04index.html`, `exerc.html`) are likely used to demonstrate web development concepts.
- **JavaScript Files**: Files like `part1.js` and `part1.1.js` contain JavaScript code, possibly for interactive examples or exercises.
- **Lesson Folders**: Each folder (e.g., `Aula 001`, `Aula 7`) seems to represent a specific lesson or topic.

## Conventions
- **File Naming**: Files are named to reflect their purpose or lesson (e.g., `04index.html` for an index file in lesson 4).
- **Folder Organization**: Lessons are grouped into folders, and files within these folders pertain to the lesson topic.

## Development Workflow
1. **Editing Files**: Modify HTML or JavaScript files directly in their respective folders.
2. **Previewing Changes**: Open HTML files in a browser to view changes.
3. **Debugging**: Use browser developer tools to debug JavaScript and inspect HTML/CSS.

## Patterns and Practices
- **HTML and JavaScript Integration**: JavaScript files are likely linked to HTML files for dynamic behavior. Check `<script>` tags in HTML files to understand dependencies.
- **Incremental Learning**: The structure suggests a progression from basic to advanced topics. Review earlier lessons for foundational concepts.

## Suggestions for AI Agents
- **Understand Context**: When editing or generating code, consider the educational purpose of the repository. Ensure examples are clear and beginner-friendly.
- **Follow Conventions**: Maintain the existing naming and organizational patterns.
- **Provide Comments**: Add comments to generated code to explain functionality, aiding learners.

## Key Files
- `exerc.html`: Likely a central file for exercises.
- `part1.js`, `part1.1.js`: JavaScript files for interactive examples.
- `Aula 7/ex01Dom.html`: May demonstrate DOM manipulation concepts.

## Notes
- No build or test workflows were identified.
- External dependencies or frameworks are not evident.
